#+title: Rosetta Code: Multiple implementations of more complex applications
#+author: Mark Clements and colleagues

The excellent web site https://rosettacode.org contains moderately simple exercises written in many different languages. This is an excellent way to investigate how different languages can implement the same algorithm.

However, the examples are typically small. The intention for this package is to implement a series of larger examples. The current examples include:

- [[file:hta/README.org][A discrete event simulation for health technology assessment]]
- A cyclic Markov model

Proposed examples include:

- Fisher's exact test
- A foreign function interface for the C math library
- A foreign function interface for the R math library
